## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add cell delimiters and code lens actions to the Positron extension (#366)
- ODBC is now turned on for the CLI as well (#344)
- `FROM` can now come before `VISUALIZE`, mirroring the DuckDB style. This means
that `FROM table VISUALIZE x, y` and `VISUALIZE x, y FROM table` are equivalent
queries (#369)
- CLI now has built-in documentation through the `docs` command as well as a
skill for llms through the `skill` command (#361)

### Fixed

- Rendering of inline plots in Positron had a bad interaction with how we
handled auto-resizing in the plot pane. We now have a per-output-location path
in the Jupyter kernel (#360)
- Passing the shape aesthetic via `SETTING` now correctly translates named
shapes (#368)
- Asterisk shape now has lines 60 degrees apart, giving an even shape

### Changed

- Reverted an earlier decision to materialize CTEs and the global query in Rust
before registering them back to the backend. We now keep the data purely on the
backend until the layer query as was always intended (#363)
- Simplified internal approach to DataFrame with DuckDB reader (#365)
- Restructured CLAUDE.md to better deal with the rising complexity of the project (#382)

### Removed

- Removed polars from dependency list along with all its transient dependencies. Rewrote DataFrame struct on top of arrow (#350)
- Moved ggsql-python to its own repo (posit-dev/ggsql-python) and cleaned up any additional references to it
- Moved ggsql-r to its own repo (posit-dev/ggsql-r)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-20

- First alpha release. No changes tracked before this
